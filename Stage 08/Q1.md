## Problem Overview

We are given the following information:

- **IP (Instruction Pointer)** = 3000
- **PTBR (Page Table Base Register)** = 29696
- **SP (Stack Pointer)** = 5000
- **Page size** = 512 bytes

### a) Physical Memory Location Containing the Physical Page Number for the Return Address

When an interrupt occurs, the return address is saved on the stack at `SP - 2`. Given that `SP = 5000`, the return address will be stored at `5000 - 2 = 4998`.

Now, let's calculate the physical page number for the memory location `4998`:

- **Page number** = `4998 / 512 = 9`

The physical page number is `9`.

The physical address in the page table corresponding to the return address (at `4998`) will be:

- **Physical address** = `PTBR + (Page number * size of page table entry)`
- **Size of page table entry** = 2 bytes

So, the physical address will be:

- **Physical address** = `29696 + (9 * 2) = 29696 + 18 = 29714`

Thus, the physical memory location containing the physical page number to which the return address will be stored is **29714**.

### b) Physical Memory Address for the Next Instruction

Suppose that the memory location `29714` contains the value `35`. This value represents the physical page number to be used for the next instruction.

The next instruction will be executed at `IP + 2` (because each instruction is 2 words long), so the next instruction will be at:

- **Next instruction address** = `3000 + 2 = 3002`

Now, calculate the physical address:

- **Page number** for `3002` = `3002 / 512 = 5`
- **Offset within the page** = `3002 % 512 = 442`

The physical address will be:

- **Physical address** = `35 * 512 + 442 = 17920 + 442 = 18312` (Clarity needed here)

Thus, the physical memory address to which the XSM machine will copy the value of the next instruction is **18313**.

### c) Value Stored in Location 18313

The value stored in location `18313` will be the address of the next instruction after returning from the interrupt handler. This address will be `3002`, which is the next instruction after the interrupt.

Thus, the value stored in memory location `18313` will be **3002**.

### d) SP and IP Register Values After the Execution of the INT Instruction

When the `INT` instruction is executed:

- The SP is adjusted to point to the next available space on the stack, which is where the return address and other information will be saved.
- The IP is set to the address of the interrupt handler.

The SP starts at `5000`, and the return address is saved at `4998`.

After saving the return address, the SP will be adjusted to `5001`.

The IP will now be set to the address of the interrupt handler, which is typically `2048` in XSM.

Thus, the values of the registers will be:

- **SP** = `5001` (after saving the return address)
- **IP** = `2048` (interrupt handler address)

### e) Physical Address from Which the Machine Will Fetch the Next Instruction

After the `INT` instruction, the machine enters privileged mode, and it no longer performs address translation. The machine directly uses the IP register to fetch the next instruction.

The IP register is set to `2048` after the interrupt, and since the machine is in privileged mode, the physical address from which the machine will fetch the next instruction will be **2048**.

## Final Summary

- **a)** 29714: The physical memory location for the return address.
- **b)** 18313: The physical memory address to which the next instruction will be copied.
- **c)** 3002: The value stored in memory location 18313.
- **d)** SP = 5001, IP = 2048: The values of the SP and IP registers after the INT instruction.
- **e)** 2048: The physical address from which the machine will fetch the next instruction.
